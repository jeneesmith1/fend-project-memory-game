## Instructions

This is a project I created as part of the Udacity Nanodegree Front End Web Developer Program.

This is a memory matching game where players try to match all of the cards in the game by uncovering two at a time to get a match.


Start by clicking on the uncovered cards in the grid until you have completed all 8 matches! 

To play again, click the restart button at the top corner.
